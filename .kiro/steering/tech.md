## Design Principles

Prefer built-in SwiftUI functionality over custom implementations. Even if a custom solution might be more polished or feature-rich, prioritize SwiftUI's native components and APIs for simplicity and maintainability.

## Dependencies

No external dependencies - uses only Apple's native frameworks (SwiftUI, SwiftData, Foundation).

## Build Commands

Build and run the app through Xcode:
- Open `DiceSack.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Select a simulator or device target
- Press Cmd+R to build and run
- Press Cmd+B to build only

The project uses automatic code signing with development team ID `UD788QN6R5`.
